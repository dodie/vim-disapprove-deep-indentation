vim-disapprove-deep-indentation
===============================

This Vim plugin disapproves deeply indented code.

![Disapproval in action](https://github.com/dodie/vim-disapprove-deep-indentation/blob/master/tty.gif "Disapproval")

By default, it shows ```ಠ_ಠ``` at the beginning of each line that is indented at least 5 levels.
It can be configured with the following variables (setting them to 0 disables the feature):

```
let g:LookOfDisapprovalTabThreshold=5
let g:LookOfDisapprovalSpaceThreshold=(&tabstop*5)
```

## Installation

You can easily install this Plugin with
[Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) or
[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle).

Vim needs to be compiled with +conceal for the face to appear.

##Inspiration
The idea came from a comment made by [StripTheFlesh](https://www.reddit.com/user/StripTheFlesh) in
[this](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/5jwjfk/python_36_released/dbjoi2a/) thread on Reddit:

```
Just use ಠ_ಠ for indents. It will remind you to not use a lot indentation levels.
```

## How it works

The plugin uses Vim's conceal feature. It does not modify the source code in any way, the disapproving
look is just a visual indicator.

Conceal depends on modifying the syntax highlighting rules. For some file types and syntax settings,
the rules defined in this plugin may conflict with the default rules applied for a filetype, making
the look of disapproval appear in the beginning of shallowly indented lines as well.

In the case you encounter this issue, feel free to open an issue.
Until it's fixed, you can disable the plugin for the problematic file types with the following command:

```
autocmd FileType SOME_FILETYPE let g:LookOfDisapprovalTabThreshold=0 | let g:LookOfDisapprovalSpaceThreshold=0
```
